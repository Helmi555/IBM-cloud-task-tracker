# ðŸŽ“ Just earned my Introduction to Cloud certificate from IBM & Cognitive Class!

# As part of my learning journey, I built a hands-on Task Tracker app using:
# ðŸ”¹ IBM Cloud Code Engine (serverless)
# ðŸ”¹ Cloudant NoSQL Database
# ðŸ”¹ Docker & CI/CD with GitHub Actions
# ðŸ”¹ Prometheus + Grafana for observability

# ðŸ”§ Gained practical experience in containerization, automated deployments, and monitoring â€” all in one real-world flow.

# A small project, but a big step into DevOps and cloud-native development!

# ðŸ”— Check out the full project on GitHub:

# Perfect for anyone starting with IBM Cloud and modern DevOps practices.
